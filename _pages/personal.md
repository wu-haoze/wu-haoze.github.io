I received my Bachelor’s degree from Davidson College in 2018, where I double-majored in Philosophy and Mathematics. Before my undergraduate, I spent most of my life in Shanghai, China. My name in Chinese is 吴昊泽. I have many hobbies, including music, literature, philosophy, travelling, and tennis.

I’m a pianist and a guitarist. My favorite composer is Maurice Ravel. For the most part of my undergraduate at Davidson, NC, I served as a pianist at the Lingle Chapel. I also performed at different occasions, including [a Chinese music concert](https://myclintonnews.com/stories/concert-for-the-new-year,4375?){:target="_blank"} in South Carolina to celebrate the Chinese Lunar new year. I love composing music.

I enjoy reading, in particular contemporary novels, both by Chinese authors and authors from worldwide. It’s a wonderful way to philosophize and access new perspectives on life. My favorite Chinese novel is 《许三观卖血记》(Chronicle of a Blood Merchant) by 余华(Yu Hua). I must’ve read the book 10 times now but it still brings me to tears. In high school, I started to record the books I have read, wish to read, and am reading on [豆瓣](https://book.douban.com/people/monkeyswedding/){:target="_blank"}.
