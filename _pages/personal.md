I obtained my PhD from Stanford University, advised by Clark Barrett. I received my Bachelor’s degree in 2018 from Davidson College, where I double-majored in Philosophy and Mathematics. Before my undergraduate, I spent most of my life in Shanghai, China. My name in Chinese is 吴昊泽. I have many hobbies, including music, literature, philosophy, traveling, and tennis.

I enjoy reading, in particular contemporary novels, both by Chinese authors and authors from worldwide. It’s a wonderful way to philosophize and access new perspectives on life. My favorite Chinese novel is 《许三观卖血记》(Chronicle of a Blood Merchant) by 余华(Yu Hua).
