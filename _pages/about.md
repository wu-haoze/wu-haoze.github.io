I am an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at Amherst College. My research aims to bridge the gap between automated logical reasoning and machine learning. Specifically, I have developed mathematical techniques to formally verify properties of AI-driven systems, being the main developer of the [Marabou verification framework](https://github.com/NeuralNetworkVerification/Marabou){:target="_blank"}. I have also employed machine learning techniques to improve the efficiency of automated reasoning tools in robust and automatic manners.
