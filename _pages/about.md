I am a PhD candidate in the Computer Science Department at Stanford University. My research interests lie at the intersection of automated reasoning and artificial intelligence. Specifically, I have developed mathematical techniques to rigorously analyze the safety of AI-driven systems. I have also employed machine learning techniques to improve the efficiency of automated reasoning tools. I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in Philosophy and Mathematics from Davidson College in 2018.
