I am a PhD candidate in the Computer Science Department at Stanford University, advised by Prof. Clark Barrett. My research aims to bridge the gap between automated logical reasoning and machine learning. Specifically, I have developed mathematical techniques to formally verify properties of AI-driven systems, being the main developer of the [Marabou verification framework](https://github.com/NeuralNetworkVerification/Marabou){:target="_blank"}. I have also employed machine learning techniques to improve the efficiency of automated reasoning tools in robust and automatic manners. 

I am a passionate educator. At Stanford, I have developed and taught a new course, [CS257: Introduction to Automated Reasoning](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs257/){:target="_blank"} in consecutive years with Prof. Caroline Trippel. I also plan to compile a textbook on this subject. Potential publishers please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
