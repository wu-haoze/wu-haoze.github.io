I am a PhD candidate in the Computer Science Department at Stanford University, advised by Prof. Clark Barrett. My research interests lie at the intersection of automated reasoning and artificial intelligence. Specifically, I have developed mathematical techniques to rigorously analyze the safety of AI-driven systems, being the main developer of the [Marabou verification framework](https://github.com/NeuralNetworkVerification/Marabou){:target="_blank"}. I have also employed machine learning techniques to improve the efficiency of automated reasoning tools in robust and automatic manners. 

I am a passionate educator. At Stanford, I have developed and taught a new course, [CS257: Introduction to Automated Reasoning](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs257/){:target="_blank"}, with Prof. Caroline Trippel. I also plan to compile a textbook on this subject. Potential publishers please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
