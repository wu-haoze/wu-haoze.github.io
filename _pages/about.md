I am an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at [Amherst College](https://www.amherst.edu){:target="_blank"}. I am also an Affiliated Researcher with VMware by Broadcom.

I envision a future where computer systems seamlessly integrate **logical reasoning** and **inductive reasoning** to automate complex tasks in a scalable, reliable, safe, and explainable manner. To get there, I develop methods to formally verify and guarantee properties of deep-learning-enabled systems. Plus, I study the integration of machine learning techniques into automated reasoning tools. 

Previously, I got my PhD in Computer Science at Stanford University, advised by Clark Barrett. Before that, I graduated with BS in Mathematics and Philosophy from Davidson College.
