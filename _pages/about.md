I am an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at Amherst College. I am also an affiliated Researcher with VMware by Broadcom.

I envision a future where computer systems seamlessly integrate logical reasoning and machine learning to automate complex tasks in a scalable, reliable, explainable, and safe manner. To get there, I develop techniques to **formally verify and guarantee properties of deep-learning-driven systems**. In addition, I investigate **machine learning techniques to accelerate logical reasoning tasks**. 

Previously, I got my PhD in Computer Science at Stanford, advised by Clark Barrett. Before that, I graduated with BS in Mathematics and Philosophy from Davidson College.
