I am a PhD candidate in the Computer Science Department at Stanford University, advised by Prof. Clark Barrett. I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Philosophy and Mathematics from Davidson College in 2018. My research interests lie at the intersection of automated reasoning and artificial intelligence. Specifically, I have developed mathematical techniques to rigorously analyze the safety of AI-driven systems. I have also employed machine learning to improve the efficiency of automated reasoning tools. I am passionate about teaching.
